# Linked-Lists-Project
implementing a linked list class that mimics the design of the LinkedList class found in the Java Standard Library. So that you can complete the assignment in a reasonable amout of time you will only be implementing a subset of the functionality found in the standard library version. Note that some of the methods have an O(1) performance requirement (see specifications). You will also be supporting forward and backward iteration via methods by implementing an interface that extends the Iterator&lt;E> interface from the Java Standard Library. To achieve efficient interation both forward and backward you will implement the list as a doubly-linked list. Finally, to support the Java for-each statement, you will implement the Iterable&lt;E> interface from the Java Standard Library.
